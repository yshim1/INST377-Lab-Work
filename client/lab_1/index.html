          GIFs are good for animations. They are kind of limited in terms of 
          color palette. Should not be used for photos. Can't have semi-opaque
          pixels. Difficult to get high detail. JPG images are good for photos.
          They can handle large color pallettes without increasing file size. Good
          for photos and images with lots of gradient. Can't have transparent pixels
          meaning you can see white edfes of image. PNGs are good for diagrams and
          icons. Deal with opacity well and don't have color pallette limitations. 
          SVGs are amazing. It is vector-based instead of pixel-based. This means it
          can scale up or down without loss of quality. This is good for responsive
          designs. One problem is that text in images need to be converted to outlines
          using image editor. If images have a lot of text, it will impact file size.
